	Security systems set up in homes can be expensive and complex to set up. The cameras used can be bulky in size and therefore difficult to successfully hide. This project is to create a home security system using a Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi camera module.

\begin{small}
 The Raspberry Spi is a way to set up a home security system that is affordable, easy to hide and not complex. It can have multiple real life uses depending on the end user. Being set up on a home network allows for having full control over the system from who can access the Raspberry to the resolution of images being used. All of the Raspberry Spi code is available to download from github which allows for endless possibilities of additional extras.
